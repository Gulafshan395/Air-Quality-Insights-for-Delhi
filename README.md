Analyzed five years of Delhi pollution data from 2018 to 2023, incorporating live data from Kaggle and a pollution website. Extracted, cleansed, and summarized the data in MS-Excel, creating a comprehensive dataset. 

Utilized MS-Excel and Power Query editor for data cleansing, including the addition of necessary columns and transformations. Identified top states and the most polluted city based on Air Quality Index (AQI). Further, employed Power BI for an interactive report, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis and visualization.

The project involved a meticulous process of extracting live data, cleansing information in MS-Excel, and creating a summary sheet for comprehensive insights.
